This is the code to run BaseCase and Non-SDN case.
For the base case we need to run initscripts on each router
For non-SDN case we need to run initscripts on each router and also run scripts in NON-SDN Folder

Initscripts are to install Quagga and Run quagga on the routers
If Quagga is not installed run the following commands:
apt-get update
apt-get install quagga quagga-doc traceroute 

Run Initscript on each Router 
eg. If you want to run it on Router1 you will use the command
sh Router1.sh
